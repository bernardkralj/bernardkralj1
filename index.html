        Wesley Wales Anderson (born May 1, 1969) is an American filmmaker. 
        His films are known for themes of grief, loss of innocence, and dysfunctional
        families. Due to his films eccentricity, distinctive visual and narrative styles,
        and frequent use of ensemble casts, critics have cited Anderson as an auteur.
        Three of his films appeared in BBC Culture's 2016 poll of the greatest films
        since 2000. <br> </br> Wesley Wales Anderson was born on May 1, 1969, in Houston, Texas,
        to Melver Leonard Anderson, who worked in advertising and public relations,
        and Texas Anne Anderson, a realtor and archaeologist. His parents divorced
        when he was eight. He is the second of three boys; his older brother, Mel,
        is a physician, and his younger brother, Eric Chase Anderson, is a writer
        and artist whose paintings and designs have appeared in several of Anderson's
         films, including The Royal Tenenbaums. <br> </br>He graduated from St. John's School in Houston in
        1987, which he later used as a prominent location in Rushmore. As a child,
         Anderson made silent films on his father's Super 8 camera, which starred
        his brothers and friends, although his first ambition was to be a writer.
        Anderson worked part-time as a cinema projectionist at Hogg Memorial Auditorium
         while attending the University of Texas at Austin, where he met his roommate
        and future collaborator Owen Wilson in 1989. In 1991, he graduated with a 
         Bachelor of Arts with a major in philosophy. He describes being intrigued
        by The Meaning of Meaning by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards.
